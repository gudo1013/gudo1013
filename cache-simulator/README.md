Scott Dobberpuhl and Jackson Gudorf
For our last project the whole thing appears to be working. Jackson and I, I think, 
understand cache well and this project ran into some errors that were semi-easy to fix. One 
error that we were getting a lot during development was a segmentation fault where we were 
setting the block size incorrectly and it was what took the most time to fix while writing this 
simulator. Another error we were getting was we were somehow incorrectly allocation our 
memory for the block data and this also caused some segmentation faults while trying to solve 
our other error, that was stated previously. The last large error that caused some grief was we 
were accessing memory addresses incorrectly, but that one was solved quickly.
The way our simulator works is very similar to the single cycle, but with some odd 
tweaks in there. First, we do the usual of setting all our variables to their default values and 
initialize our cache variables. We then create our structs based on the configuration we 
received from the command line arguments. Then we start to our while loop that will run 
through every instruction till it hits a halt. We first do our instruction fetch and our first check 
for cache and do our hit and misses. If itâ€™s a miss, we read into cache and move on. If it is a hit,
we just get it. Right after we update our LRU. We check for halt and if we hit it, we stop.
