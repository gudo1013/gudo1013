Hello, you can use "make" to create the executable simulator
loadstall.asm and .mc test if we do a load stall for a lw correctly
lotsoadd.asm and .mc test if we data forward multiple times correctly
mixed.asm and .mc test if all the instructions (other than jarl) work correctly
once youâ€™re all done with these you can use "make clean" to eliminate the executable
